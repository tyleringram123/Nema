Attached is a quick example of something I made. Some additional factors that could adjust how you might want to configure the map and such I put below. In addition to that, attached is the python I ran to create the map, the "Sample Data" that I used to create it, and html of the map which you should be able to open and works in your browser. Let me know if you have any questions.

How many clients are on the theoretical list? (if you're estimating 10,000+ records a slightly different approach might be better)
Would this be preferred to be hosted on a website so anyone with a link or in your company can access it? (if so would have to be done differently and hosted EX. "https://txcrimemap.com/")
Are there filters/layers that would be preferable? (I color coded the makers based on AUM and have a filter for that in the top right of the map that lets you filter out based on AUM)
What type of mapping markers or style would be preferable? I used standard markers but this could be adjusted based on needs and what you would like to see can do things such as heat maps, choropleth, cluster markers, ect.
